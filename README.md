# CD Snatcher

This project is a take on the classic Hideo Kojima game "Snatcher"....but as a CarD game.

## Current Status
Roughly 4% of the way done. Main menu has been the focus lately. 

## Roadmap
Next on the list is to finalize the dialogue systems behaviors. Currently dialogue works but it is stuttery, due to the array being propogated.
